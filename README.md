# GAN_tutorials

This is a tutorial using the code released at Kaggle workshop for GAN at ODSC East 2018 workshop.

In this tutorial, the Kaggle Digit Recognizer dataset is used along with the utils from Kaggle.

Additionally, Wasserstein loss and Adam optimizers are selected as default loss functions and optimizers.


TODO: Add the jupter notebook of these for better visualization!
